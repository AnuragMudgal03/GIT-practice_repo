Nascent dreams

Woke up staring at the sun
Lost in thought, thinking of something fun
Still having a sense of loss
Lacking the motivation to walk across
Blank canvas calls my name
Without a vision I have nothing to stain

Living a life feels like a chore
Looking at clouds standing on a floor
Thinking of catching the smokes sky high
But how can a wingless bird fly
Feeling conflicted about others' fame
Without a goal living feels like a shame

Hoping for finding some inspirational quote
It might make me stay afloat
But how far can faking take me
There has to be a way for the world to see
The potential hidden inside of me
But without a dream I can't even be free
